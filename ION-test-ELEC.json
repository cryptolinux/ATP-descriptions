  "description": "Electrons (ELEC) are generated by the ION blockchain as a Proof of Work (POW) mining reward. Mining is the exclusive way that Electrons are brought into existence. As competition among miners intensifies, the degree of difficulty grows, increasing the investment that must be made to win the block reward. Spending Electrons will unlock the contents of tokenized and platform-based assets that represent access to goods, services, and prizes on the ION blockchain, the ionomy platform, and the ION gaming ecosystem.",
